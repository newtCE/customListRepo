CustomList Method Operator Override (-):
Within the CustomList class the (-) operator can be used to create a new CustomList object
by subracting duplicate list values found in one list from another. This process follows the
order of operations so the CustomList on the left side of the (-) operator will be the basis
for our new CustomList with duplicate values found in the CustomList found on the right side
of the (-) operator removed.
Values found in CustomList2 (right side of the (-) operator) will not appear in the resulting list.

Parameters:

CustomList(left side of operator)
Base list from which values are to be removed.

CustomList(right side of operator)
List from which values to be removed from the base list are derived.

Returns:
CustomList
A new custom list with any duplicate values removed.

Example Logic:

CustomList1 [1,1,2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,6,6,7,7]
CustomList2 [3,5,7,9,10]

CustomList1 - CustomList2 = ResultList [1,1,2,2,4,4,6,6]

Example Code:

CustomList<int> list1=new CustomList<int>()[1,2,3,4];
CustomList<int> list2=new CustomList<int>()[3,4,5];
CustomList<int> resultList=list1-list2;

Console.WriteLine(toString(resultList));

//OUTPUT
//"1,2"
